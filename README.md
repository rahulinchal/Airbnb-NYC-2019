Conclusion
This Airbnb ('AB_NYC_2019') dataset for the 2019 year appeared to be a very rich dataset with a variety of
columns that allowed us to dive deep into each significant column presented.
To begin, firstly, we identified the data of top ten host_id and we figured out that top host ID has 327 listings.
Secondly, we take "Neighbourhood_Group", and we found that Airbnb listings in New York City are
concentrated in five neighborhoods: "Brooklyn," "Manhattan," "Queens," "Staten Island," and "Bronx".
Moreover, we also learned from this chart that "Manhattan" and "Brooklyn" have the most hotel properties.
Then, we found that Manhattan is the most expensive as the rental charges are more evenly distributed
across all the price ranges, median price in Manhattan is approx $150 thats around double the median price
of Bronx and the distributions in Queens and Staten Island appear to be very similar, while the Bronx
appears to be the cheapest of the three.
Thirdly, we take the data of "room_type" and figured out that it is devided into three subcategaries and we
can observe that the Entire Home/Apartment has the highest share, followed by the Private Room, and the
least preferred is Shared Room. Futhermore, entire Home/Apartment is listed most near Manhattan, while
Private Rooms and Apartments Near Brooklyn are Nearly equal.
Fourthly, we put our latitude and longitude columns to good use by creating a geographical map of Newyork
city which represents the location of all the areas with their latitude and longtitude. In other map is Colorcoded for listing price of room as per the location.
In addition, we returned to the first column "name" and found out the words from the hotel names, as well
as the count for the most frequently used words by hosts. Hosts prefer to use Private
rooms,brooklyn,central park,modern,nyc and Beautiful these words in their listing to seek customer
attention.
Finally, we looked for the listings with the "most reviews". Count the rating of top ten reviewed hotels, and
found out The top 10 most reviewed listings on Airbnb for NYC have an average price of $65 per night, with
the majority of them under 50, and 9/10 of them are "Private Room" types, with the top reviewed listing
